name: "Legacy installer"
description: >
  The legacy installer represents the default (legacy) behavior used by r2modmanPlus
  & Thunderstore for installing packages. The documentation for this behavior
  is maintained at
  [the r2modmanPlus wiki](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/wiki/Structuring-your-Thunderstore-package),
  although it likely does not fully describe all the game-specific edge cases


  This installer is implicitly used for packages which don't explicitly declare
  their installers.
